# Employee Salary Prediction

## Overview
Employee Salary Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at estimating employee salaries based on various features such as education level, job role, experience, and location. The project is designed to support HR professionals and employers in making informed and data-driven compensation decisions.

## Objectives
- Build a predictive model to estimate salaries based on key employee attributes.
- Identify the most influential features affecting salary distribution.
- Present insights through visualizations to support data interpretation.
- Develop an intuitive interface for easy interaction with the model.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – for scripting and model development
- **Pandas & NumPy** – for data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn** – for machine learning modeling and evaluation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for visualizing data trends and model performance
- **Joblib / Pickle** – for saving and loading trained models

## Project Highlights
- Successfully trained and evaluated multiple regression models.
- Achieved strong model performance using metrics like R² and MAE.
- Generated clear visual representations to support insights.
- Optional web interface allows real-time salary prediction based on user input.

## Future Scope
- Integrate additional variables such as industry type and company size.
- Enhance model performance with advanced algorithms like XGBoost or ensemble methods.
- Deploy the application using cloud services for broader accessibility.
